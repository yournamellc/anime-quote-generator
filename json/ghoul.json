Yes, some ghouls walk a path that leaves sorrow in their wake, but just like humans, we can choose a different path altogether. We have a lot to learn, both your kind and mine. We need to stop fighting, and start talking. Because when it comes to the state of the world, you can't point your finger at ghouls or humans. We're all to blame."

They way I think of it, literature allows the reader's consciousness to deeply relish the author and be closer to him. And so, we freely walk around the world of the story from the yarn spinner's point of view. It's only when you immerse yourself in the world of a book that you are able to forget just who you are."

All you're doing is indulging in this twisted self-value that you have to yourself. And if you don't, you won't last. Eventually, you will break and become useless. Once that happens, you'll break and become discarded."
